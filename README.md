# Boot.dev Projects

This repository contains projects completed as part of the [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev) curriculum. Each project focuses on building specific programming skills through guided learning.

## Repository Update 2025

I will no longer be using this repo to combine all the BootDev projects into one repo. Will be leaving this repo here to preserve all the commit histories, however, will be creating a seperate repo for each new project going forward.

## Projects
- [Asteroids](asteroids/): A classic Asteroids game built with Pygame.
- [Bookbot](bookbot/): A command-line text analysis application.
- [Static Site Generator](static-site-generator/): A tool to generate static sites from markdown files.
