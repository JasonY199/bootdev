command-line application in Python that does static analysis on text files

> My first project on boot.dev!

**This is the guided projects description:**

You'll build a real command-line application in Python that does static analysis on text files, or rather, entire novels like "Frankenstein". You'll be guided through the set up of a professional development environment using VS Code, Git, and Github. This is the perfect first Python project for beginners.
